    "# NeMo Guardrails \n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational applications. Guardrails are specific ways of controlling the output of a large language model, such as not talking about politics, responding in a particular way to specific user requests, following a predefined dialog path, using a particular language style, extracting structured data, and more. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501) introduces NeMo Guardrails and contains a technical overview of the system and the current evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails allow you to create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- input rails - these perform modifications or extra LLM checks on the input message (called an utterance)\n",
    "- output rails - these perform modifications or extra LLM checks on generated bot message\n",
    "- dialogue rails: flows written in Colang\n",
    "    - These describe the course of action in topic-specific dialogues\n",
    "    - These can activate the execution of actions\n",
    "    - LLM-embedding similarity is used to compute to determine which flow to follow\n",
    "- execution rails - these can call \"actions\" defined in python scripts. These can for instance call third-party API's.\n",
    "- knowledge base integration\n",
    "- retrieval rails - these perform modifications on the provided relevant chunks, or can call actions which in turn can call third-party API's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colang\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use NeMo guardrails, one must understand the basics of the Colang programming language. It might be useful to go over the documentation before you continue this notebook. Below are the [Core Colang concepts](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/getting_started/2_core_colang_concepts/README.html?highlight=canonical) behind the language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bot / LLM-based Application: a software application that uses an LLM to drive\n",
    "- Utterance: the raw text coming from the user or the bot.\n",
    "- Intent: the canonical form (i.e. structured representation) of a user/bot utterance.\n",
    "- Event: something that has happened and is relevant to the conversation e.g. user is silent, user clicked something, user made a gesture, etc.\n",
    "- Action: a custom code that the bot can invoke; usually for connecting to third-party API.\n",
    "- Context: any data relevant to the conversation (i.e. a key-value dictionary).\n",
    "- Flow: a sequence of messages and events, potentially with additional branching logic.\n",
    "- Rails: specific ways of controlling the behavior of a conversational system (a.k.a. bot) e.g. not talk about politics, respond in a specific way to certain user requests, follow a predefined dialog path, use a specific language style, extract data etc.\n",

    "NeMo guardrails \n",
    "Specify the LLM used to generate the responses. \n",
    "Nemoguardrails can work with multiple models: one to generate the final responses, one to perform the embedding similarity search in order to estimate the user intent. Additionally, it is also possible to specify specific third-party LLMs to perform specific tasks that involve prompting (\"self-checking\") like fact checking. In case nothing is specified, a guardrails selects a default embedding provider of the same provider, specified [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails/tree/develop/nemoguardrails/embeddings/embedding_providers). \n",
    "\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "models:\n",
    " - type: main\n",
    "   engine: openai\n",
    "   model: gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\n",

    "NVIDIA recommends to use [GPT3.5-turbo-instruct](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/b1efde53be364a73914f58805a001731-Paper-Conference.pdf) for guardrails and in general instruction tuned models.  This model is already fine tuned on a wide range of tasks with human feedback. This is the model we will use throughout  this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to use a specific other model for the embeddings, specify it with `type: embed`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "This notebook does not experiment with this, but you can easily try and change the model names in the configuration files to see how the LLM chosen can impact the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Application-specific instructions and a sample conversation can be provided in the config.yml file. These can provide general instructions about what type of assistant the bot is, e.g. \"the bot is a costumer service bot for the company XYZ\"  or \"the bot always replies in formal, scientific language\". Providing a sample conversation is similar to single-shot prompting, where a single example is provided in the prompt that exemplifies the task to be performed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general instructions are similar to a system prompt, and can be provided in the config file under `instructions`, e.g.:\n",

    "        The bot always answers truthfully. If the bot does not know the answer to a question, it responds it does not know.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample conversation can also be specific in the .yml file: \n",
    "\n",
