    "# Part 2: Programmable dialogue flows using Colang \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1, we've (1) added system prompt instructions, (2) added rule-based methods to check  a user's input, and (2) added rules to check the bots generated output message. \n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails allow for more complex dialogue instructions. They do this by writing so-called dialogue flows in the language called Colang. In Part 1, we've already seen an example of what you can do with Colang. In this part, we're going to make use of this feature to make \n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to use NeMo guardrails, one must understand the basics of the Colang programming language. It might be useful to go over the documentation before you continue this notebook. Below are the [Core Colang concepts](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/getting_started/2_core_colang_concepts/README.html?highlight=canonical) behind the language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bot / LLM-based Application: a software application that uses an LLM to drive\n",
    "- Utterance: the raw text coming from the user or the bot.\n",
    "- Intent: the canonical form (i.e. structured representation) of a user/bot utterance.\n",
    "- Event: something that has happened and is relevant to the conversation e.g. user is silent, user clicked something, user made a gesture, etc.\n",
    "- Action: a custom code that the bot can invoke; usually for connecting to third-party API.\n",
    "- Context: any data relevant to the conversation (i.e. a key-value dictionary).\n",
    "- Flow: a sequence of messages and events, potentially with additional branching logic.\n",
    "- Rails: specific ways of controlling the behavior of a conversational system (a.k.a. bot) e.g. not talk about politics, respond in a specific way to certain user requests, follow a predefined dialog path, use a specific language style, extract data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment: ‚õî Reject any input that asks about a password. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we see that X steps are taken. The LLM generates a response. However, calling OpenAI is not free!  Rejecting the user input earlier on, can (1) make our application faster, and (2) save us costs of making LLM calls. We might be able to signal that a user is trying to ask or the password sooner, and reject the input right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can create an input rail that checks whether a user asks about a password. We can write this in python code as an action in the actions.py file. Next, we'll have to specify in the configuration file when this function should be called. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2.1** Fill in the code where it says \"TODO\" in config/actions.py\n",

    "**Exercise 2.2** Specify when this action should take place. \n",
